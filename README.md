## Description
Create an AI agent using reinforcement learning and Q tables which given an input
of sensor data, estimates what time of the day the room had most number of
people in it based on humidity levels. We display this on a Flask webapp.

## Manifesto
A RL agent that is capable of solving logical problems by itself given an
environment and its rules. Itâ€™s aimed at helping developers create a model that
figures out ways of doing things that humans never thought of.

## Installation
Place your csv/tsv files under a folder called dataset.
Download Gym.
Clone our repo.
Copy the RLAI folder to where you installed gym/envs.
Run graphRLAI.py.
